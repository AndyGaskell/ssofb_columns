SSOFB Columns - A very simple Joomla content plug-in for having responsive columns in articles

This is a very simple bootrap column plug-in. It suports Bootstrap fluid responsive layout. It assumes you have a bootstrap template, like Protostar.

At the relevant viewport, typically 768 pixels wide, the columns will switch from being side-by-side to being on-top of each other.

This plug-in supports 2, 3, 4, 6 or 12 columns, as per the bootstrap 12 grid system

To use it, just use the following syntax in your article:

    {cols}
    This is my first column, as much text as you like here. 
    {colbr}
    This is my second column, as much text as you like here, or images by the way. 
    {colbr}
    This is my third column, content can be whatever. 
    {/cols}
